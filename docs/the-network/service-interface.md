A crucial component of the ATOR Network's value proposition, in addition to the growth and distribution of relays through protocol incentives and its improved decentralization, is the interface it will build to proliferate services directly within the network. Unlike services in the 'clearweb', ATOR services will not be bottlenecked by exit nodes, will preserve the privacy of the service provider, and will make it harder to de-anonymize the users interacting with it.

### A Unified Interface For Services

ATOR aims to build the infrastructure needed to easily allow existing web2 and web3 services to onboard themselves onto the network. This process leverages relays to build dedicated service circuits; rotation of relays within service circuits; the development of service-specific directories to build out redundancy as examples of the innovative protocol modifications needed to build this interface. 

Regardless of the specific implementation, the end goal is clear - for ATOR to be the communication layer for all DePin and privacy services, including blockchain endpoints, by building a self-contained end-to-end anonymized ecosystem.

### Built For all Developers

A core tenet of the ATOR network is lowering the barriers to participation and development of the network. All developers by design will be able to build on the network, create services within the network and innovate for it. ATOR believes in true decentralization and that includes no centralized limitation on innovation.

ATOR will enable use-cases within onion-routing previously not possible or feasible, by building out relay circuits dedicated for high-bandwidth and enterprise use-cases. These will include relays capable of routing other types of traffic, if needed, such as UDP. We don't know the full scale of all products and services that will be made usable and private for the first time; we are building a generalized interface to allow services to leverage relays and make these use-cases possible.

### Interoperability with Arweave L2

Both users and service providers will be able to pay relays using our Arweave distribution Layer. From storage and bandwidth to private compute and machine learning, users will be able to create obscured 'service pools' of tokens that relays within the network use. In addition, one possibility is staked users being able to access services of their own, including endpoints or dedicated bandwidth in the network.
